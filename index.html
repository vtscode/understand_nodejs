		<li>Arguments: values you give your program that affect how it runs 
			<p>essentially passing parameters to a function</p>

		</li>
		<li>a Js engine: a program that converts js code into something the computer processor can understand
			<p>And it should follow the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and what features it should have. Example V8 engine</p>

	<p>Breakpoint :
		A spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code.
		<code>so we can figure out what's going on</code> 
	</p>

	<p>Module:
		a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code 
		<code>js didn't have this before</code>
	</p>

	<p>CommonJs modules:
		an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured
	</p>

	<p>First-class functions:
		everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.
		<code>You can use function like strings, numbers, etc(i.e pass them around, set variables equal to them, put them in arrays, and more)</code>
	</p>

	<p>An expression :
		a block of code that results in a value
		<code>Function expressions are possible in jS because functions are first-class.</code>
	</p>

	<p>Invoke: run the function 
		<code>we can also say 'call' the function.</code>
